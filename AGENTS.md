# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI assistants (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini CLI, and
any other agent harness) working with this repository.

**This file is the entry point and is deliberately short.** It carries only what
every agent needs before doing anything. Detailed rules and conventions live as
separate files under [`.agents/rules/`](.agents/rules/) and are loaded on demand
— read the one whose trigger matches your current task, not all of them.

## Non-negotiables

These apply to every task, in every session:

1. **Pixi is the only package manager.** Never invoke `pip`, `conda`, or `venv`
   directly. Run `pixi install` before any other Pixi command.
2. **Verify before you claim.** Never report work as complete, fixed, or passing
   without having run the check and read its output. The minimum gate here is
   `pixi run pre-commit-all`.
3. **Change surgically.** Every changed line must trace directly to the request.
   Don't refactor, reformat, or "improve" adjacent code you weren't asked to
   touch.
4. **Ask instead of assuming.** If the request has multiple readings or
   something is unclear, stop and name it — before implementing, not after.
5. **Never open a PR** without working through
   [`.agents/rules/contribution-discipline.md`](.agents/rules/contribution-discipline.md)
   in full, including human review of the complete diff.

## Rule Index

Load the rule file whose trigger matches what you are about to do.

| Rule file                                                              | Load when                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [working-agreement.md](.agents/rules/working-agreement.md)             | Starting any implementation, refactor, or bugfix — the behavioral baseline |
| [contribution-discipline.md](.agents/rules/contribution-discipline.md) | About to commit, open a PR, or asked to "contribute" / "fix some issues"   |
| [pixi-environments.md](.agents/rules/pixi-environments.md)             | Running any command, adding a dependency, or editing `pixi.toml`           |
| [pre-commit-and-quality.md](.agents/rules/pre-commit-and-quality.md)   | Committing, preparing a PR, or claiming checks pass                        |
| [repository-map.md](.agents/rules/repository-map.md)                   | You need to know what this repo is, where a file lives, or what CI runs    |
| [onboarding.md](.agents/rules/onboarding.md)                           | First-time setup, or helping a new contributor get started                 |
| [troubleshooting.md](.agents/rules/troubleshooting.md)                 | A documented command fails or behaves unexpectedly                         |

## Provenance

The behavioral and contribution rules are adapted from two upstream sources and
generalized for this repository:

- [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) `CLAUDE.md` — agent
  contribution discipline (`contribution-discipline.md`).
- [multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills](https://github.com/multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills)
  `CLAUDE.md` — behavioral guidelines that reduce common LLM coding mistakes
  (`working-agreement.md`).

## Trust These Instructions

These instructions were generated through comprehensive exploration and testing
of the repository. Commands have been validated to work correctly. **Only
perform additional searches if:**

- You need information not covered by `AGENTS.md` or `.agents/rules/`
- Instructions appear outdated or produce errors
- You're implementing functionality that changes the build system

For routine tasks (adding files, making code changes, running checks), follow
these instructions directly without additional exploration.
