# Relationship Building & Graph Linking Guide

Concepts in an OKF v0.2 bundle do not exist in isolation. Linking related
concepts creates a high-signal knowledge graph that allows future agents to
discover relevant dependencies, constraints, and historical context.

## 1. Core Principle: Semantic Linking Without Fragmentation

Relationships should represent meaningful semantic connections between distinct
concepts with independent lifecycles.

### Avoid Artificial Fragmentation

- **Anti-pattern**: Creating 5 separate 1-line concepts (`decision.md`,
  `rationale.md`, `alternatives.md`, `consequences.md`, `author.md`) and linking
  them all together.
- **Best Practice**: Keep cohesive units together in one concept file. Only
  split into separate concepts when entities have independent lifecycles or are
  referenced across multiple domains.

## 2. Common Domain-Neutral Relationship Patterns

| Domain         | Source Concept                 | Target Concept                 | Relationship Description                          |
| :------------- | :----------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Software**   | `decisions/adr-001`            | `architecture/database`        | _"implements PostgreSQL with connection pooling"_ |
| **Software**   | `bugs/conn-leak`               | `architecture/database`        | _"affects connection pool eviction logic"_        |
| **Software**   | `research/grpc-benchmarks`     | `decisions/adr-002`            | _"justifies gRPC over REST for microservices"_    |
| **Coaching**   | `sessions/2026-09-02`          | `clients/jane-doe`             | _"coaching session with Jane Doe"_                |
| **Coaching**   | `goals/public-speaking`        | `clients/jane-doe`             | _"target milestone for Jane Doe"_                 |
| **Literature** | `reviews/thinking-fast`        | `books/thinking-fast-and-slow` | _"critical review and chapter notes"_             |
| **Literature** | `books/thinking-fast-and-slow` | `topics/cognitive-biases`      | _"explores heuristic decision-making"_            |

## 3. Creating Relationships with Tooling

Use `okf_relate` (MCP) or `okf relate` (CLI) to link two concepts
deterministically with automatic frontmatter and markdown updates:

#### Option A: Native MCP Tool (Preferred)

```json
// Tool: okf_relate
{
  "source_id": "decisions/adr-001",
  "target_id": "architecture/database",
  "description": "implements connection pooling strategy"
}
```

#### Option B: CLI Fallback

```bash
# Agent JSON mode
okf relate decisions/adr-001 architecture/database knowledge \
  --desc "implements connection pooling strategy" \
  --json

# Human-readable relate
okf relate decisions/adr-001 architecture/database knowledge \
  --desc "implements connection pooling strategy"
```

**JSON Output Example**:

```json
{
  "status": "related",
  "source": "decisions/adr-001",
  "target": "architecture/database",
  "description": "implements connection pooling strategy",
  "updated_files": ["knowledge/decisions/adr-001.md"]
}
```

## 4. Graph Integrity & Validation

Whenever links are added or removed:

1. **Check for Broken Links**: Every link target must resolve to a valid concept
   path or ID within the bundle.
2. **Check for Orphaned Concepts**: Ensure key concepts are reachable from index
   files or related concepts.
3. **Run Strict Validation**:

   - Native MCP Tool: `okf_validate(strict=true)`
   - CLI Fallback: `okf validate knowledge --strict`

   Strict validation ensures:

   - 0 broken links / dangling pointers
   - 0 orphaned concepts
   - 0 schema or frontmatter errors
