# Clean Branches

Clean up local and remote git branches.

## Arguments

Optional: `all`, `stale`, `merged`, or a specific branch name. If omitted,
prompt the user.

## Instructions

1. Run these commands in parallel to gather branch information:

   - `git branch` (local branches)
   - `git branch -r` (remote branches, exclude HEAD)
   - `git branch --merged main` (branches merged into main)
   - `git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate --format='%(refname:short) %(committerdate:relative) %(upstream:track)' refs/heads/`
     (local branches with age and tracking status)

2. Categorize each branch (excluding `main` and `feedback-screenshots`):

   | Category            | Definition                                                        |
   | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Merged**          | Branch is in `git branch --merged main` output                    |
   | **Stale**           | Last commit is older than 30 days                                 |
   | **Orphaned remote** | Remote branch exists but no local branch tracks it                |
   | **Orphaned local**  | Local branch exists but remote is gone (`[gone]` tracking status) |
   | **Active**          | Has recent commits and is not merged                              |

3. If no argument was given or it is unclear:

   - Display a summary table of all branches grouped by category with branch
     name, last commit age, and local/remote status
   - Ask the user which categories to clean: merged, stale, orphaned, or all
   - Wait for the user's response before proceeding

4. If the argument specifies a category or "all":

   - Show the list of branches that will be deleted
   - Ask for confirmation before proceeding

5. Delete branches:

   - Local branches: `git branch -d <name>` (safe delete, merged only) or
     `git branch -D <name>` (if user confirms force delete for unmerged)
   - Remote branches: `git push origin --delete <name>`
   - Run `git fetch --prune` after remote deletions

6. Confirm results: show what was deleted and what remains.

## Rules

- NEVER delete `main`, `master`, or `feedback-screenshots` branches
- NEVER force-delete (`-D`) without explicit user confirmation
- Always show what will be deleted before doing it
- If a branch has unmerged commits, warn the user and ask before force-deleting
- Run `git fetch --prune` at the end to clean up stale remote refs
- If there are no branches to clean, say so and exit

## Note on squash-merged branches

GitHub's squash merge rewrites commits, so a squash-merged branch will NOT
appear in `git branch --merged main` and `git branch -d` will refuse it. Before
force-deleting, confirm the work actually landed — check that the PR shows as
merged (`gh pr list --state merged`) and that `git diff main..<branch>` holds no
unique work.
