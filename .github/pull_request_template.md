## 🤖 AI assistance disclosure

<!-- Disclosure is required, lightweight, and shame-free. Its purpose is
     reviewer calibration, not judgment. Leaving the box unchecked asserts
     that no AI assistance was used. -->

- [ ] This PR is AI-assisted

**Tool / model / version:**

<!-- e.g. Claude Sonnet 4.6 via Claude Code -->

## 🔍 Author verification

<!-- Required on AI-assisted PRs. Reviewers spend attention proportional to
     the "less certain" list, so be specific and honest. -->

**I personally verified:**

<!-- e.g. ran the full test suite against dataset X; stepped through the
     boundary-condition logic by hand -->

**Less certain about:**

<!-- e.g. the rewritten retry logic in client.py:120-160 — please look
     closely -->

**AI-generated portions:**

<!-- Which files/functions, and roughly how much -->

- [ ] I own every line in this PR and can explain any of it on request
- [ ] I am available for a synchronous walkthrough if a reviewer requests one

## 🧪 How to test
